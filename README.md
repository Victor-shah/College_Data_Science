# Activity 01: Introduction to Python Programming

## Basics of Python

Python is a popular programming language for data science and machine learning due to its simplicity and readability. Understanding Python is crucial for effective coding

Variables and Assignmets:
* Variables are used to store data values. Example: x = 10
* Some datatypes supported by python are integers(int), floating-point numbers(float), strings(str), booleans(bool), lists(list), dictionaries(dict), etc.
* Comments are used to add explanantions or notes within the code. They are preceded by the # symbol.
* print Statement is used to display the output on the console. The print() function is used for display.

## Class Activity

Dictionaries are versatile data structures in Python that are commonly used in data science and machine learning projects. They allow you to store and retrieve data using key-value pairs.

In the activity, data structures of python are used. With these data structures, the following functions supported are also used. 

# Activity 02: Python Libraries

Python has libraries with large collections of mathematical functions and analytical tools. In this activity, the following libraries were used:

## Pandas
This library is used for structured data operations, like import CSV files, create dataframes, and data preparation

## Numpy
This is a mathematical library also known as numeric python. It has a powerful N-dimension array object, linear algebra, Fourier transform, etc.

## Matplotlib
This library is used for data visualization. From this library we are able to make scatter plot, line plot, bar graph, histogram, etc.

## Data Preparation

This is the process of preparing raw data so that it is suitable for further processing and analysis. The following dataset is of .csv(comma separted values) type. To access this dataset, the pandas library is used. The function read_csv() is able to create a dataframe from this dataset. Now, the dataframe is ready for further processing

## Data Preprocessing

Functions in python can be used to clean, transform and preprocess the raw data. For example, you can create functions to handle missing values, normalize data, or apply feature scaling. For cleaning of the data , either the rows can be dropped using the dropna() function or the null values can be filled with mean or median of the dataframe using the fillna() function.

## Data Visualization

The graphical representation of data and information is known as data visualization. Where visual elements likes charts, graphs, plots can be used. In the activity bar graph, pie chart, scatter plot, line graph and histogram are created.
