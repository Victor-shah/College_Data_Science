# Activity 01: Introduction to Python Programming

##Basics of Python

Python is a popular programming language for data science and machine learning due to its simplicity and readability. Understanding Python is crucial for effective coding

Variables and Assignmets:
* Variables are used to store data values. Example: x = 10
* Some datatypes supported by python are integers(int), floating-point numbers(float), strings(str), booleans(bool), lists(list), dictionaries(dict), etc.
* Comments are used to add explanantions or notes within the code. They are preceded by the # symbol.
* print Statement is used to display the output on the console. The print() function is used for display.

##Class Activity

Dictionaries are versatile data structures in Python that are commonly used in data science and machine learning projects. They allow you to store and retrieve data using key-value pairs.

In the activity, data structures of python are used. With these data structures, the following functions supported are also used.
